oh it's a raining sunday and some way it's
making me feel blue
i can never ever bring myself to work oh no no
hey if you feel the same way too then it's the
song for us two
let's flow and roll relax and chill today so
lazy
上手くやりすぎる方が問題だ
程よく "我が" の "まま" いこうって話さ
you got me?
honey don't you worry
there's gonna be a beautiful day:)
don't cry, no don't have to try
to be like someone else
let's just keep on walking talking
it's one of those unlucky daze:(
trust me, it's gon be okay
so honey don't you worry no more
「不安や不満の一つや二つは
人生におけるスパイスなんだ」とか?
でもそれが増えすぎて
本当の味がわからなくなってしまう時だってあるんだ
上手く飲み込んで行儀よくこなすのが
大人だなんて馬鹿げた話さ
you feel me?
honey don't you worry
there's gonna be a beautiful day:)
don't cry, no don't have to try
to be like someone else
let's just keep on walking talking
it's one of those unlucky daze:(
trust me, it's gon be okay
so honey don't you hurry no more
あのコがどうとか?
あの人がすごいとか?
so what? それがどうした?
you're the king of your life!
see honey after walking talking
it's already the happiest day:)
i told you it's gon be okay
so honey don't you worry no more
there's gonna be a beautiful day:)
keep on walking talking
honey don't you worry no more
